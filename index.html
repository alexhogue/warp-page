            Working with a team of four, the goal of this project was to design a home page for the startup Warp that serves as 
            an aggregator to allow for increased discovery and usage of Warp’s features.

            <h3>Project Brief</h3>
            <p>
              <a href="https://www.warp.dev/" target=”_blank”>Warp</a>
              is a customizable terminal with collaborative tools and AI integration.
              Warp did not have a centralized home page for users to view information about 
              their files, team, usage, account info, and learn more about Warp. Currently, most of 
              this information is housed in settings, making it difficult to find.

            <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
            <p>Based on the initial sketches, the following focues were implemented into our wireframes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>focus on intiutiveness with inspiration from Figma Home, Google Drive and GitHub home</li>
              <li>centralize live sessions, user metrics, activity, and educational content with use of a sidebar</li>
              <li>considertation of user states (both new and active users)</li>
              <li>focus on customizability</li>
              <li>split up team and personal funcitonality</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

        <h3>Intended Impact</h3>
        <p>
          Our main goal with the home page was to create a user-friendly,
          glanceable interface that allows users to understand their current state
          and easily access their content. We achieved this through a split
          layout: the left sidebar displays metrics, live sessions, activities,
          and resources, and the main section displays folders, files, and
          sessions. Additionally, since Warp is designed for collaboration, it was
          important for users to seamlessly switch between personal and team
          views. Ultimately, our design aligns with the priorities outlined in our project brief and 
          enhances the discovery of Warp’s features by organization key functionalities 
          on the home page.

      <h2>Wireframe Revisions</h2>
      <p>
        Based on feedback we recieved from the Warp founders as well as peers, we revised our initial drafts.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We felt that having four screens was too few to show user interaction
        with the various components, so we created more screens in our second
        iteration.</li>
        <li> We removed the metrics from the left sidebar since metrics
        was last on our priorities list, and it did not feel necessary for users
        to constantly see this information (better in the account page).</li>
        <li>we received a lot of feedback about making the drive more
        customizable and realized that we were missing basic features, like
        trash and a search bar. Therefore, in addition to including these
        features, we added sorting, filters, and two modes for viewing.</li>
        <li>we changed the toggle (navigating between “Personal” and “Team”) to a drop-down
        since the founders clarified that in the future Warp would allow users to be on
        multiple teams.</li>
        <li>we wanted to make it easy to navigate between
        the home page and terminal, so opted to use a top nav bar, and added a new tab for the home page, 
        replacing the drive tab since drive is now integrated into the home.</li>

        <div id="style-guide-text">
          <p>We based the style guide on the existing Warp branding provided in the Warp brand guidelines and added additional 
            elements including specific font sizes and an icon library to match the design we created. </p>
          <p>The Warp brand guidelines are based on a minimal, dark mode design. This allows the product to work seamlessly for developers, 
            who often work with software in dark mode, and they are often online for long periods of time, so having a website that 
            is minimalistic, professional, and easy to read is critical. The main font is sans-serif, simple, and readable, and the terminal 
            font is very similar to that of other terminals on the MacOS and Linux systems, aligning with users' mental model 
            of a terminal. Warp uses primarily black and white of varying shades, matching with the dark mode 
            theme as well as additional colors as accents that create fun and eye-catching elements that 
            make Warp more than a basic terminal.</p>
          <p>We checked the style guide with the WCAG AA guidelines for accessibility and found that the dark gray on black could 
            be an issue for accessibility, so we added more contrast between the text and buttons and the background. 
            The icons used are minimalistic and simple to make it clear what each icon represents to a developer.</p>

      <p>Our prototype uses the same structure and design as our final wireframe which is shown and 
        described above. We added in new colors, fonts, and icons as indicated by our style guide to 
        bring our design to life. The design focuses on depicting the design of the home page based 
        on the user state and the various actions that they can take.</p>

      <p>We  emphasized key design principles in our final prototype to fulfill our users' needs.
        We wanted to ensure that our design aligns with the mental model users currently have of a 
        homepage/dashboard. To do this, we ensured that the homepage is a central location where users 
        can access everything on the application. This includes the ability to access the 
        terminal, files, settings, teams, view activity, and account information.</p>
        <p>We implemented hierarchical design and scan patterns to create a layout that is efficient for users. Our 
        scan pattern is based on the F pattern, where users scan horizontally across the top, then vertically 
        down the left side, and finally horizontally across the screen. With this in mind, we have the welcome 
        and navigational information across the top, the sidebar on the left side with key information, and 
        access to files in the center of the screen. This allows users to quickly find what they need on 
        the page. Regarding hierarchy, we ensure that each section has a larger heading and smaller body 
        text so users can easily scan for the main sections and land on what they need to read further.</p>

          <p>Through this project, I learned a lot about designing as a team and communicating with clients in order 
            to achieve a design goal. Overall, communication was a huge part of this process– both within 
            my team and with the startup founders. From the very beginning, I prioritized understanding the needs 
            and expectations of our client, and this involved active listening during meetings, thoughtful questions, 
            and thorough documentation of their feedback and concerns.</p>
          <p>One of the key challenges was translating their vision into tangible designs. This required not 
            only creative problem-solving but also a deep understanding of design principles and user experience 
            considerations. My team took their feedback and continuously iterated on our designs, constantly striving 
            to align with their expectations while incorporating our own expertise and insights.</p>
          <p>In this process, collaboration within my team was essential; we leveraged each other's strengths 
            and expertise, dividing tasks effectively to ensure that every aspect of the project received attention to 
            detail.</p>
